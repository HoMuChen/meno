# Session secret for cookie encryption (REQUIRED)
# Generate a secure random string for production (minimum 32 characters)
SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret-here-minimum-32-chars

# Firebase Admin SDK credentials (REQUIRED)
# Option 1: Path to service account JSON file
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./meno-2287c-firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc-bdb6a13c57.json

# Option 2: Service account JSON as environment variable
# Download service account key from Firebase Console > Project Settings > Service Accounts
# FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY={"type":"service_account","project_id":"meno-2287c",...}
# 
# IMPORTANT: When using FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY, the private_key field should contain
# literal \n strings (not actual newlines). The code will automatically convert \\n to \n.

# Important Notes:
# - These credentials are REQUIRED for the app to work with server-only authentication
# - Download the service account key from Firebase Console
# - Keep credentials secure and never commit them to version control
# - For production, use environment variables instead of files
