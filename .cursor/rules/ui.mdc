# UI Rules

## Technology Stack

- **Component Library:** All UI components are built using [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for accessible, composable, and customizable React primitives.
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is used for all utility-first styling, ensuring consistency and rapid development.

## General Best Practices

- **Reusability:** Prefer shadcn/ui components (e.g., `Button`, `Input`, `Dialog`, `DropdownMenu`) for all forms, dialogs, and interactive elements to ensure accessibility and design consistency.
- **Utility Classes:** Use Tailwind utility classes for layout, spacing, color, and typography. Avoid custom CSS unless absolutely necessary.
- **Responsiveness:** Use Tailwind's responsive utilities (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, etc.) to ensure layouts adapt gracefully to all screen sizes.
- **Dark/Light Mode:** Default to light mode (`bg-white`, `text-zinc-900`), but structure components so that dark mode can be added easily in the future if needed.

## Layout & Structure

- **Containers:** Use rounded corners (`rounded-2xl`), subtle borders (`border-zinc-200`), and shadows (`shadow-xl`) for modals, cards, and dialogs.
- **Spacing:** Use Tailwind's spacing utilities (`p-8`, `mb-4`, `gap-4`, etc.) for consistent internal and external spacing.

## Typography

- **Headings:** Use bold, left-aligned headings (`font-bold`, `text-2xl`) for modal and section titles.
- **Descriptions:** Use lighter, left-aligned text (`text-zinc-500`) for subtitles and descriptions.
- **Labels:** Use `text-zinc-800` for form labels, and always associate them with their inputs for accessibility.
- **Body Text:** Use `text-zinc-900` for main content on light backgrounds.

## Forms & Inputs

- **Inputs:** Use shadcn/ui `Input` with Tailwind classes for a white background, light border (`border-zinc-200`), dark text, and subtle placeholder (`placeholder:text-zinc-400`).
- **Form Layout:** Stack fields vertically with clear labels and adequate spacing.

## Buttons

- **Primary Actions:** Use shadcn/ui `Button` with a light background (`bg-zinc-100`), dark text, and full width for main actions. Add hover states (`hover:bg-zinc-200`).
- **Secondary/Cancel Actions:** Use a white background, light border, and dark text (`text-zinc-700`), with a hover effect (`hover:bg-zinc-100`).
- **Destructive Actions:** Use red text or icons for delete actions, and always show a confirmation dialog before destructive changes.

## Modals & Dialogs

- **Use shadcn/ui `Dialog` components** for all modal interactions.
- **Background:** White (`bg-white`), with a subtle border and shadow.
- **Padding:** Use generous internal padding (`p-8` or similar).
- **Header:** Title and description are left-aligned and spaced apart from the form/content.
- **Footer:** Action buttons are stacked vertically with spacing.

## Sidebar & Navigation

- **Sidebar:** 
  - Project names are bold to distinguish from meeting names.
  - Meetings are listed under their respective projects, indented for hierarchy.
  - Use icons (e.g., folder, file) for visual cues.
- **Dropdown Menus:** 
  - Use shadcn/ui `DropdownMenu` and submenu components.
  - Menus appear below and left-aligned to the trigger button.
  - Use submenus for actions like "Move to Project".
  - Destructive actions (like "Delete") are styled in red.

## Accessibility & Responsiveness

- **Focus States:** All interactive elements (buttons, inputs) have clear focus styles for accessibility, as provided by shadcn/ui and Tailwind.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure all dialogs, dropdowns, and forms are fully keyboard accessible.
- **Responsive Design:** Use Tailwind's responsive utilities to ensure usability on both desktop and mobile.
